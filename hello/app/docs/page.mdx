# Getting Started!

Hello there, this is the official documentation on Doxium. Here you can learn and understand how to use it!

## What is Doxium?

Doxium is a CLI tool that allows the ease of creation and integration of documentation into your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.
This CLI is able to either create a new Next.js project with Doxium fully installed and configured or integrate Doxium into an existing project. This allows for efficient and easy creation of documentation.

My goal is to provide developers an easy gateway into using and customizing documentation to their liking without wasting so much time. This project is fully open source and you can contribute [here](#Contribution).

## Main features

Here are some key features and specials that Doxium has to offer, be aware of bugs!
