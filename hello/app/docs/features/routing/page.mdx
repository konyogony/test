# Routing

Routing in Doxium is entirely file-based, working similarly to Next.js, without the need to specifically type in the routes and their names.

## How does it work?

First of all, you have to specify your `base-url` parameter in the Doxium config - this will define where in your project structure you have your documentation. 
This option is usually set to `app/docs` or `app` by default (depending on whether you have chosen to use the /docs folder during setup).
Then, in the directory you have just specified, you can start by creating `page.mdx` files. The name for them will come from the parent directory.
To create a folder, you can create a directory without a page.mdx file but containing other pages, then it will properly count as a folder.
> e.g. `about/page.mdx` yields a page with 'About' as its name. The pages are ordered by their 'path' and folders, so setting a custom order is not possible for now.



## Features currently supported (as of alpha release)

| Feature | Supported|
| :--------| :-------: |
| Creating pages | ✅ |
| Creating folders | ✅|
| Folders containing their own page | ❌ |
| Specific order of pages | ✅ | 


## Ordering

You can create a `_sort.json` file in the directory you want sorted and create an object called `sort` which will contain an array with the pages you want to have in order.
This will search for the names specified in the order specified and arrange them accordingly.

```json
{
    "sort": ["name1", "name2", "name3"]
}
```
