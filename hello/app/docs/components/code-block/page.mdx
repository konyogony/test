# Code blocks

Code blocks are used to represent code in your documentation with proper highlighting. These code blocks are made using [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/),
therefore there are many themes to choose from, available by editing `"shiki-theme"` in `doxium.json`.

This is a built-in component, so it doesn't need to be imported from anywhere.

## Simple example:

Writing this:

````mdx
```tsx
const HelloWorld = () => console.log('Hello World!')
```
````

Will yield the following result on your page:

```tsx
const HelloWorld = () => console.log('Hello World!')
```

Notice that writing `tsx` after the backticks will define the language to be used for syntax highlighting. The list of available languages right now consists of:
- ts / js
- tsx / jsx
- rs
- html
- mdx
- bash
- sh
- css
- json

You can change the list of available languages by editing line **15** in `@/lib/highlighter.ts`. In the future, this will be more accessible via the `doxium.json` config.

# Advanced usage

Here are more of the advanced features available in Doxium's code blocks. You are able to combine all the topics to be discussed later, unlocking a creative potential.

## Code focus

You can make the reader focus on some part of the code by adding `// [!code focus]` after the line to make it not blurred. On hover, all the text will be revealed. 
You can also escape this by adding a backslash after the exclamation mark, `// [\!code focus]`

```json
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed" // [!code focus] 
    }
}
```

## Code highlight

You can highlight specific lines of code by adding `// [!code highlight]` after the line. This will make the whole line slightly white. This is fully customisable on line **125:127** in `@/app/globals.css`. 
Additionally, you can escape this by adding a backslash after the exclamation mark, `// [\!code highlight]`

```json
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed" // [!code highlight]  
    }
}
```

## Code deleted (--)

You can make specific lines of code red, as if deleted in `diff` mode, by adding `// [!code --]` after the line. This is fully customisable on line **120:122** in `@/app/globals.css`. 
Escapable by adding a backslash after the exclamation mark, `// [\!code --]`

```json
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed" // [!code --]  
    } // [!code --]  
}
```

## Code added (++)

You can make specific lines of code green, as if added in `diff` mode, by adding `// [!code ++]` after the line. This is fully customisable on line **116:118** in `@/app/globals.css`. 
Escapable by adding a backslash after the exclamation mark, `// [\!code ++]`

```json lineNumbers
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed" // [!code ++]  
    } // [!code ++]  
}
```

## Toggle top bar

You can toggle on/off the top bar in the code block which usually contains the icon, language and copy button. 
This is done by adding the `noTopBar` flag after declaring your language. For example, inputting this code:

````mdx
```json noTopBar
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```
````

Will result in this:

```json noTopBar
{
   "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```

### IRL example

```bash noTopBar
bunx doxium@latest init
```

## Toggle line numbers

You can toggle on/off the line numbers, which will be displayed in a darker tone to the left, by adding the `lineNumbers` flag after declaring your language.
For example, inputting this code:

````mdx
```json lineNumbers
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```
````

Will result you this:

```json lineNumbers
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```

## Toggle copy button

You can toggle on/off the copy button, although the user is still able to manually copy the text, by adding the `noCopyButton` flag after declaring your language.
For example, inputting this code:

````mdx
```json noCopyButton
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```
````

Will result you this:

```json noCopyButton
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```

## Name property

You can replace the language text (e.g. React) with a custom file name, by adding the `name=''` property after declaring your language.
For example, inputting this code:

````mdx
```json name='doxium.json'
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```
````

Will result you this:

```json name={'doxium.json'}
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```


## Highlighting specific word

You can highlight specific key word throughout all of your code, by adding `// [!code word:]` property on the first line.
For example, inputting this code:

````mdx
```json 
// [/!code word:shiki]
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```
````

Will result you this:

```json 
// [!code word:shiki]
{
    "style": { 
        "shiki-theme": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```




# Limitations and errors

In this section, I will discuss some limitations and errors that occur, which either will be fixed or have no fixes.

Summary:
| Issue | Notes | 
| :-----: | :-----: |
| [[Shiki] 100+ instances have been created](#shiki-400-instances-have-been-created) | Partially fixed by caching the highlighter  |
| [Prettier moving // [!code highlight] to another line](prettier-moving-object-object-to-another-line) | Fixed by adding `.mdx` to `.prettierignore` |


If you are able to somehow fix any of these issues, make a [PR](https://github.com/konyogony/Doxium/pulls). Your contribution will be greatly appreciated :)


## [Shiki] 400 instances have been created

You may receive the following error (or a similar one) in the console when developing your app:

``[Shiki] 400 instances have been created. Shiki is supposed to be used as a singleton, consider refactoring your ....``

This has been partially fixed in the latest commit by caching the highlighter in the singleton file. This error might still occur, but is nothing to worry about since this happens only in developement, during hot-reloading.


## Prettier moving `// [!code highlight]` to another line

This is a well-known error and issue by the Prettier community that it is able to move your comments to another line if it doesn't have space or meets some different parameters. 

Currently, I don't think there is a proper fix, so my solution is to add `.mdx` to `.prettierignore`, so that it doesn't format the file at all. This obviously comes at the cost that you have to manually format your file.
