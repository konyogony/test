# Cards

You can use cards to give extra information to the reader or navigate them to a different page. You will first import the element from `doxium/card` and then use it as a React Element.
First, set the `title` property to your liking and then add content to the inside of the element. 

- You can set the `href` tag to make it clickable. 
- Additionally, you can set the `full` property to true to have the card take the full width of the page.
- If you want to have the URL open in a new tab, you will have to set the `newTab` property to true.

## Examples

<Card title={'Alerts'} href='/docs/features/alerts' newTab={true}>Check out alerts! They are used to attract attention and convey important information </Card>
<Card title={'Did you know?'}>Did you know, one developer has made all of this? But, with help from [PadowYT2](https://github.com/padowyt2) `test`</Card>

```mdx
import Card from 'doxium/card'

<Card title={'Alerts'} href='/docs/features/alerts' newTab={true}>
    Check out alerts! They are used to attract attention and convey important information
</Card>
<Card title={'Did you know?'}>
    Did you know, one developer has made all of this? But, with help from [PadowYT2](https://github.com/padowyt2) `test`
</Card>
``` 

> As you can see, there is an issue with the hyperlink not getting highlighted. I have purposely decided not to solve it.

## Now with group

You can use the CardGroup component to make a grid of cards, although don't forget to import it first from `doxium/card-group` <br />
You will have to set a `cols` property - how many columns you want to have in the group. Rows are added automatically depending on the columns.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title={'Alerts'} href='/docs/features/alerts'>Check out alerts! They are used to attract attention and convey important information</Card>
    <Card title={'Did you know?'}>Did you know, one developer has made all of this? But, with help from [PadowYT2](https://github.com/padowyt2)</Card>
</CardGroup>

```mdx
import Card from 'doxium/card'
import CardGroup from 'doxium/card-group'
<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title={'Alerts'} href='/docs/features/alerts'>
        Check out alerts! They are used to attract attention and convey important information
    </Card>
    <Card title={'Did you know?'}>
        Did you know, one developer has made all of this? But, with help from [PadowYT2](https://github.com/padowyt2)
    </Card>
</CardGroup>
```
